A novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
disease (COVID-19) has been recently identified as an infectious disease 
affecting the respiratory system of humans. This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 
that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like 
symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet 
particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. 
The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom 
based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the 
majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The 
diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected 
people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. 
Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is 
crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was 
available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for 
detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been 
developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of 
diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based 
diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum 
antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic 
procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated 
machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, 
they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes 
imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost 
effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such 
diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, 
which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is 
developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral 
flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), 
and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown 
promising results in rapid detection of pathogens. Diagnosis holds a critical 
importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the 
pathogen available in the market. This review sums up the different diagnostic 
approaches designed or proposed to combat the crisis of widespread diagnosis due 
to the sudden outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic which has induced unprecedented 
ramifications, severely affecting our society due to the long incubation time, 
unpredictably high prevalence and lack of effective vaccines. One of the 
interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. 
Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality 
rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution 
to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral 
strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the 
efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible 
interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only 
to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for 
immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine 
platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also 
enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster 
and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of 
COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between 
COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association 
using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the 
COVID-19 vaccine formulation options. This study will contribute to paving the 
way towards the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially for the 
immunocompromised individuals.

Due to the high prevalence and long incubation periods often without symptoms, 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 
millions of individuals globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic. Even with the recent approval of the anti-viral drug, 
remdesivir, and Emergency Use Authorization of monoclonal antibodies against S 
protein, bamlanivimab and casirimab/imdevimab, efficient and safe COVID-19 
vaccines are still desperately demanded not only to prevent its spread but also 
to restore social and economic activities via generating mass immunization. 
Recent Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine may 
provide a pathway forward, but monitoring of long-term immunity is still 
required, and diverse candidates are still under development. As the knowledge 
of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and interactions with the immune system continues to 
evolve, a variety of drug candidates are under investigation and in clinical 
trials. Potential vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 include repurposed 
drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antiviral and antigenic proteins, peptides, and 
genetically engineered viruses. This paper reviews the virology and immunology 
of SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapies for COVID-19 to vaccination, principles and 
design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, and the promises and 
roles of vaccine carriers in addressing the unique immunopathological challenges 
presented by the disease.

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to 
diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests 
cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, 
rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are 
used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other 
and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we 
compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 
patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and 
infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large 
amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples 
containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed 
to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. 
The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding 
infectious SARS-CoV-2.

Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in 
recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to 
summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and 
discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of 
re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients 
after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged 
COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after 
discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. 
Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered 
COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR 
tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading 
to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive 
testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of 
the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to 
discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the 
standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens 
should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 
viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel 
assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its 
sensitivity and specificity.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus known 
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is 
associated with several fatal cases worldwide. The rapid spread of this pathogen 
and the increasing number of cases highlight the urgent development of vaccines. 
Among the technologies available for vaccine development, DNA vaccination is a 
promising alternative to conventional vaccines. Since its discovery in the 
1990s, it has been of great interest because of its ability to elicit both 
humoral and cellular immune responses while showing relevant advantages 
regarding producibility, stability, and storage. This review aimed to summarize 
the current knowledge and advancements on DNA vaccines against COVID-19, 
particularly those in clinical trials.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of 
coronavirus that causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been 
the most challenging pandemic in this century. Considering its high mortality 
and rapid spread, an effective vaccine is urgently needed to control this 
pandemic. As a result, the academia, industry, and government sectors are 
working tightly together to develop and test a variety of vaccines at an 
unprecedented pace. In this review, we outline the essential coronavirus 
biological characteristics that are important for vaccine design. In addition, 
we summarize key takeaways from previous vaccination studies of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlighting the pros and cons of each immunization 
strategy. Finally, based on these prior vaccination experiences, we discuss 
recent progress and potential challenges of COVID-19 vaccine development.

Several vaccine candidates to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have 
entered or will soon enter large-scale, phase 3, placebo-controlled randomized 
clinical trials. To facilitate harmonized evaluation and comparison of the 
efficacy of these vaccines, a general set of clinical endpoints is proposed, 
along with considerations to guide the selection of the primary endpoints on the 
basis of clinical and statistical reasoning. The plausibility that vaccine 
protection against symptomatic COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward 
more SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic is highlighted, as well as the 
potential implications of such a shift.

A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a 
prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take 
medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) 
infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has 
rapidly spread around the world, causing ~14 million active cases with ~582,000 
deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been based on 
a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral antigen 
detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found as the 
most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection kits, 
exclusively the ones that were issued an "Emergency Use Authorization" from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural components 
of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an understanding of the 
scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods that are still in 
the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection based on the reports 
available so far.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a 
pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019. Nucleic acid testing is 
the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method 
reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 
diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with 
suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this 
study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic 
acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our 
findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience 
longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The 
IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of 
nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for 
diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.
